**Remember that this code only works when a live ESPN game is going on**
I haven't tried any other games except for baseball so I dont know if it works for other sports yet
Remember to `pip install` all libraries
to `pip install`, go to your python terminal, CMD and type `pip install request-html`
**REMEMBER: You import the module as `request_html` BUT pip install it as `request-html`**
If you want to check if you already  have it installed just do `pip freeze`
